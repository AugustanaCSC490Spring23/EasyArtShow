## Clean Code practice
1. Make sure your variables, functions' names are meaningful. 
2. Follow correct name convention. For JavaScript, it is camelCase. If it is a constant like password, do UPPER_CASE. 
3. Document your functions. What does it do. What are the variables. What does it return. 
4. Comment on code you think would be hard for your teammates to understand. Don't overdo it.
